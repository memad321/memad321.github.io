        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology may be commonly understood as a human-made, tool-like resource. But in popular discourse, the development of technology is also depicted as an inevitable process that evolves independently from humans, with a nature of its own occurring outside of being a human. This sort of cultural construct affords conceptualizations of technology as an autonomous force that has an impact on people. The impact depends on whether technology is treated neutrally as a tool for some purposeful use or if it is treated as a non-neutral force that always has an effect on society regardless of its proposed uses . In regard to education, a lot of discussion has emerged asking how technology has transformed, or will transform, the ways of teaching and learning . In terms of musical activities, critical discussion has also been presented as to how technologies may enhance or degrade learning of “natural” musical skills, musicianship, or musical understanding, or how they are able to transform people’s embodied relationship with music , even constituting bodily choreographies of musical activities .

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology is often introduced into a social system with the stated intention of making life easier for people. As technology becomes more pervasive in everyday life, the assessment of technology’s presence in relationships and its impact on how humans interact with one another is an emerging area of study. There are many perspectives on the relationship between technology and human interactions and relationships. It is purported that the integration of technologies in everyday life can have profound effects on human relationships, in both positive and negative ways. More notably, technologies impact on or interfere with how individuals engage in interpersonal relationships, behave within relationships, and project feelings and meanings including displays of emotions and love. Essentially, the new technological landscape now connects to what it means to be human.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">This is Critical</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Technology has helped to modify human behavior by creating a gap between people and reducing intimacy. In an age where robots and AI are slowly replacing humans within the workplace, this interaction between humans and machines is only set to increase.The phenomenon of virtual distance also harms the serve and return interaction that shapes brain architecture and neural connections. This interaction is an action-reaction based sociological mechanism where, for instance, a child or infant cries, which should result in a cascade of responses from a parent or other adult.This is critical as it is noted that an overuse of technology has often resulted in a lack of empathy among some, who are so disconnected that they are unwilling to engage in helping behaviors.

This means to give technology and human relations equal priority and importance. To teach students how to use logical processes to find truth in the natural world
